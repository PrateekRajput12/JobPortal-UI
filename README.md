- # FormData 
  - FormData is a built-in JavaScript object that allows you to construct and send key-value pairs, including files, to a server using multipart/form-data.
  # headers()
  - When submitting a form that includes files (like images, PDFs, or videos), a normal application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded request cannot handle file uploads. multipart/form-data allows sending both text fields and files as separate parts within the same request.
